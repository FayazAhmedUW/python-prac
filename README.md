Practicing python in VS Code

Small projects/problems to practice python skills.
Currently includes:
Script to solve NYT spelling bee and provide a list of answer words (needs a better list to draw words from, currently gives many words not in the NYT dictionary)
Script to provide a valid coloring of a graph, where no 2 adjacent nodes share a color.
